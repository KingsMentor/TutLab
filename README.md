# TutLab
Tutlab provides a guided, tutorial, hands-on coding experience by rendering content from markdown on github repository.

It takes away the hazzle of having to build the codelab template and bother about different styling and designs, allowing tutors to focus on creating a rich content only.

It builds off of ![Google's Codelab template](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/codelab-components).

This  example on ![Github Repo](https://github.com/KingsMentor/codelab/tree/master/buildingsmallerapk) produces this ![sample][http://opentutlab.appspot.com/posts/kingsmentor/codelab/buildingsmallerapk].
